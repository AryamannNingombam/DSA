find the longest increasing subsequence 
in an array of n elements. This is a 
maximum-length sequence of array elements 
that goes from left to right, and each element
 in the sequence is larger than the previous 
 element. For example, in the array

6
2 -- 
5 -- 
1
7 -- 
4
8 -- 
3
the longest increasing subsequence contains 4 elements:
