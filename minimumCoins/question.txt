We consider a problem where we are given a 
set of coins and our task is to form a sum of
money n using the coins. The values of the coins
are coins={c1,c2,...,ck}, and each coin can be
used as many times we want. What is the minimum
number of coins needed?
For example, if the coins are the euro 
coins (in cents) {1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200}
and n = 520, we need at least four coins.
The optimal solution is to select coins 
200+200+100+20 whose sum is 520.
